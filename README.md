I and my friends wanted to play a game of simultaneous chess, and then I thought, what if we played **L**iterally **S**imultaneous **Chess**?

## Rules

1. There are no turns, the white player locks its move, and then the black player does (the code allows it to be in the opposite order too) - so the game is simultaneous.
1. All the pieces move like normal chess pieces.
1. If a piece is captured it dies.
1. If the paths of two pieces cross in the same move they both die.
1. There is no check or checkmate (or any other game ending condition), you need to take the king in order to win.

## Install requirements

```sh
pip3 install pygame
```

## Run

```sh
python3 chess.py
```
